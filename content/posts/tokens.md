## What Are Tokens?

When you provide a prompt to an LLM, it doesn't process the raw text directly. Instead, it first breaks the input into smaller units called **tokens**. These tokens can be as short as a single character or as long as a commonly used word or phrase. Each token is then converted into a unique numerical ID. This is what the model actually understands and uses to generate responses.

Understanding tokens is crucial because they're the fundamental currency of LLM interactions. Every character you type, every word you use, and every symbol you include gets converted into these numerical representations.

### Token Examples

For example, consider this text snippet. While it contains 252 characters, it breaks down into just 53 tokens:

```
Many words map to one token, but some don't: indivisible.

Unicode characters like emojis may be split into many tokens containing the underlying bytes: ü§öüèæ

Sequences of characters commonly found next to each other may be grouped together: 1234567890
```

You can experiment with tokenization using [OpenAI's tokenizer tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to see how your prompt gets broken down.

## How Tokenization Works

Tokenization is the process of converting raw input text into tokens ‚Äî the basic units that LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude understand and process. Before a model can generate a response, your input prompt goes through a tokenizer that maps sequences of characters into numerical IDs.

### Tokenization in Action

For instance, the sentence "I love programming!" might be tokenized as:

```
["I", " love", " programming", "!"]
```

Each token corresponds to a unique number in the model's vocabulary. A massive dictionary containing 10's of thousands to 100's of thousands of tokens.

### Common Tokenization Methods

Different models use various tokenization strategies:

- **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**: Combines frequent character pairs to form subwords. Used by GPT models.
- **WordPiece**: Used in BERT, works similarly to BPE by breaking words into subword units.
- **SentencePiece**: Treats input as a raw stream of Unicode characters, often used in multilingual models.

These methods help models efficiently handle rare words, emojis, code, mathematical symbols, and text in multiple languages.

## Why Tokenization Matters

Understanding tokenization helps you interact more effectively with LLMs in several key ways:

### Token Limits and Context Windows
Each LLM has a maximum token limit called a context window (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo supports 128k tokens, Claude models have varying limits). This includes both your prompt and the model's response. Knowing this helps you craft efficient prompts that maximize the available space for responses.

### Cost Optimization
Many API-based models charge based on the number of tokens processed. Understanding tokenization helps you write more concise prompts, directly reducing costs while maintaining effectiveness.

### Response Quality
Poorly structured prompts that don't respect token boundaries can lead to truncated responses or unexpected behavior. Well-tokenized inputs generally produce better outputs.

## Practical Examples

Let's examine how tokenization works with a common sentence:

**Input**: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

**Tokenized version**:
```
["The", " quick", " brown", " fox", " jumps", " over", " the", " lazy", " dog", "."]
```
**Total**: 10 tokens

Notice how spaces are typically included with words (except at the beginning of sentences), and punctuation often becomes separate tokens. This helps the model understand context and proper spacing.

## Thinking in Tokens: Best Practices

To optimize your LLM interactions, develop a "token mindset":

### Be Aware of Token Density
- Common words usually equal one token
- Uncommon words may split into multiple tokens (e.g., "indivisible" might become ["ind", "ivis", "ible"])
- Emojis, special characters, and symbols often require multiple tokens
- Long numbers may be efficient or expensive depending on the tokenizer

### Optimize for Efficiency
- Write concise, clear prompts
- Remove unnecessary words without losing meaning
- Use common vocabulary when possible
- Test complex prompts in tokenizer tools when needed

### Plan for Context Limits
- Longer prompts leave fewer tokens for responses
- This is especially important for summarization or analysis tasks
- Consider breaking very long inputs into smaller chunks

## Key Takeaways

Tokens are the fundamental building blocks that allow LLMs to process and understand human language. While we think in words and sentences, models operate entirely at the token level. Mastering this concept helps you:

- Write more effective prompts
- Manage context windows efficiently  
- Reduce API costs
- Achieve better model performance

The next time you interact with an LLM, remember: think in tokens, not just words. Every character matters, and understanding how your text gets tokenized is the key to unlocking more powerful and efficient AI interactions.
