Hi there! I'm Ganesh Varma, and I have a deep passion for understanding how things work under the hood. I spend most of my time exploring, experimenting, and breaking things apart to truly understand complex systems. This natural curiosity led me to pursue software engineering as my career.

I graduated from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus (BPHC). An experience that deeply shaped how I think, solve problems, and approach challenges.

I'm currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at **DigitalOcean**, where I'm building distributed container registry. Previously, I've worked at:
- **Tensorfuse** - Serverless GPU solutions on AWS
- **RudderStack** - Customer data pipeline platform
- **IDfy** - Integrated identity platform

My daily work revolves around Distributed Systems, Container Technologies, File Systems, Database Systems, and AI. I've started writing [posts](/posts) about these topics, sharing insights and lessons learned from hands-on experience.
