Hi peeps, Iâ€™m Ganesh Varma. I have a deep love for exploring how things work. I spend most of my time playing, breaking, and learning to truly understand systems. That curiosity naturally led me to become a software engineer.

I graduated from BITS Pilani Hyderabad (BPHC), which was a great experience and shaped my life in many ways.

I'm currently working as a founding engineer at Tensorfuse, where we're building next-generation serverless AI infrastructure.

My daily work revolves around Distributed Systems, Containers, Filesystems, Databases, and AI. I'm writing [posts](/posts) on these topics to share what I learn.
